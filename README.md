Statistics Calculator:


  This is a simple calculator written in Python that calculates the mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation. The input is given by the user, who inputs their data one by one. The program then calculates those 5 problems and prints them out to the user, along with the number of data points they entered and a nice message. 

Inspiration:


   This is a project I started in my first Python course to help augment my understanding of the material by combining it with another class I was taking, statistics. One of the instance methods in the Calculator class is 'sum_my_list' that sums up the numbers in a list without calling the 'sum' function in Python. I did this manually so give myself more practice writing python code. I have since made the program more efficient and included classes so that it utilizes object oriented principles. I will continue to develop it as I learn more about coding and mathematics and if I think of some interesting features to add to it, I will, so stay tuned. 
    
Build Status:


  Currently it works as advertised, but I am in the process of making the mode method more explicit such as in the case of several numbers that appear many times in a larger dataset input by the user. 
This is the message presented to the user when the program is run:

This is what it looks like after users enter their data and press enter. We also see the error message presented to the user if they don't enter an integer or float.
